Linux Users

Check the current user 
- whoami

sudo = super user do

Use the below command to add a new user to the system
adduser user_name (This command takes most of the info required at the time of creating the user) : Requires root

To look for all the users in our system:
sudo cat /etc/passwd

O/P:-
thor:x:1001:1001:,,,:/home/thor:/bin/bash
x  means your password is stored in a separate file called shadow.(/etc/shadow)
1001 is his id(uid) and second 1001 is his group id(gid)

Check below cmd to see the password file 
sudo cat /etc/shadow
O/P :- thor:$y$j9T$O50o13GsRwEs0Vl.WHy5P.$KYYTDYKb0I6RyTBikwwzBSxUlmf/GJ2JCK9oPEHDAL6:18795:0:99999:7:::    (Hashed version)

Adding a user with a lazy cmd:
sudo useradd ironman

/etc/passwd file
O/P:- ironman:x:1002:1002::/home/ironman:/bin/sh

Use below to add password to ironman
sudo passwd ironman

Now we change the shell of ironman from sh to bash:-
sudo usermod ironman --shell /bin/bash
sudo cat /etc/passwd
O/P:- ironman:x:1002:1002::/home/ironman:/bin/bash

ironman still doesn't have a home directory for him
cd /home
ls
O/P:- thor  user176701

Changing the name of the user with 'usermod -l':
sudo usermod -l tonystark ironman
O/P:- tonystark:x:1002:1002::/home/ironman:/bin/bash

Addiing users hulk, spiderman, loki, captainamerica and drstrange
sudo useradd hulk -m (-m for adding a home directory)
sudo useradd spiderman -m
sudo useradd loki -m
sudo useradd captainamerica -m
sudo useradd drstrange -m
cat /etc/passwd
O/P:-
thor:x:1001:1001:,,,:/home/thor:/bin/bash
ironman:x:1002:1002::/home/ironman:/bin/bash
hulk:x:1003:1003::/home/hulk:/bin/sh
spiderman:x:1004:1004::/home/spiderman:/bin/sh
loki:x:1005:1005::/home/loki:/bin/sh
captainamerica:x:1006:1006::/home/captainamerica:/bin/sh
drstrange:x:1007:1007::/home/drstrange:/bin/sh

We will add thanos as a user and set his password:
sudo useradd thanos -m
sudo passwd thanos

sudo is like an infinity gauntlet:
we have sudo access but the new users created do not.

Change your user account using su - user_name(by default it is root):
But we don't have the root password so we can use sudo
su -
Password: 
O/P:- su: Authentication failure
$sudo su -
┌─[root@htb-duofxkoclh]─[~]
└──╼ #
Now '#' means we are root user
So we logout now to become ironman
If we use sudo su - ironman we don't need the password.
but here we login with password

If we try to add new user pepperpotts with ironman as user 'sudo useradd pepperpotts' it says:
ironman is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.
 
sudoers file defines who can use sudo.
Be careful editing sudoers file.
logout and use your account with sudo permission on.

To Open 'SUDO' file use cmd:
sudo visudo
It will open sudo file

Page down
%sudo is a group
Add thanos user in sudoers file.
To give him permission to useradd add below text after root line in sudo file:
thanos ALL = /sbin/useradd	(Gives thanos access to one command)

To give thanos all permissions add text:
thanos ALL = ALL
save and exit the file
Thanos user now have all access to the linux system.
