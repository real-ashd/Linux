Linux Users

Check the current user 
- whoami

Use the below command to add a new user to the system
adduser user_name (This command takes most of the info required at the time of creating the user) : Requires root

To look for all the users in our system:
sudo cat /etc/passwd

thor:x:1001:1001:,,,:/home/thor:/bin/bash
x  means your password is stored in a separate file called shadow.(/etc/shadow)
1001 is his id(uid) and second 1001 is his group id(gid)

Check below cmd to see the password file 
sudo cat /etc/shadow

sudo usermod ironman --shell /bin/bash
sudo cat /etc/passwd
O/P:- ironman:x:1002:1002::/home/ironman:/bin/bash
