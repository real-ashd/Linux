Creating hardlinks and softlinks:
To create a hardlink of a file follow the below syntax:   
ln original_filename hardlink_name  (This contains the same inode as original and its contents)   (We can also use path to specify a location)

To create a softlink(shortcut) of a file follow the below syntax:
ln -s original_filename softlink_name (This contains different inode than the original file and doesn't have its contents)  (We can also use path to specify a location)

We can create a softlink for a directory but not a hardlink.
Softlink for a dir can be created with below syntax:
ln -s original_dirname softlink_name

Using '-' filters
-R : recursive
-i : Prompt check
-v : Verbose  (What the command did)
